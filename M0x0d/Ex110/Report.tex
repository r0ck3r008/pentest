\section*{Attack Narrative}
A social engineering campaign targeted at employee of \textit{F4rmc0rp}, \textit{Phineas Philatelist}, involved luring him to visit an malicious website hosted on a server managed by \textit{Pr0b3}.
The victim was spotted incessantly visiting the webpage (Fig \ref{tcpdump1} and \ref{tcpdump2}).

        \label{tcpdump2}
\end{figure}


A lure of hypothetical stamps' collection was set up. The malicious page \textit{kali.pr0b3.com/stamps/collection.html} was embedded with a javascript hook (Fig \ref{html_page}).

\end{figure}
Once it was done, the victim accessed the malicious web page and his browser was hooked and secret cookie was harvested (Fig \ref{beef}).
