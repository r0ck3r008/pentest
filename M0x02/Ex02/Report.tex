\subsection{Task 01}
The very first task is to find the name of the woman who owned the house before Dr. Wilson bought the house in his undergraduate school town.
The following methodologies were employed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Find the town of undergraduate school:}\\
		To find where Dr. Wilson has his undergraduate studies, his \href{https://www.cise.ufl.edu/wilson-joseph/}{information page} at UF served the purpose.
		His undergraduate school was Florida State University which is in \textbf{\textit{Tallahassee, Fl}} which is in the \textbf{\textit{Leon County}}.
	\item{Finding out James Esry and relevant residence:}\\
		Next visiting the \href{https://www.leonpa.org}{Leon County Records Website}, especially the \textit{Owner Search} section, revealed the house address \textbf{\textit{901 BUENA VISTA DR, Tallahassee, Florida}}.
	\item{Confirming the address:}\\
		To confirm the address, the \href{https://cvweb.leonclerk.com/public/clerk_services/official_records/download_document.asp?book=4973&page=168}{warranty deed} given at the same search result page mentions and exchange between \textit{Joseph N. Wilson} and \textit{Theresa A. Wilson} and James Esry.
	\item{Finding the name of ex-owner:}\\
		Another \href{https://cvweb.leonclerk.com/public/clerk_services/official_records/download_document.asp?book=4215&page=1325}{warranty deed} mentions Ethel Ramsey transferring the property to Capital City Trust Company.
	\item{Building up the KEY003:}\\
		Since the ex-owner is now known, Ethel Ramsey, the KEY003 can be trivially built using the information provided in the objective document.
		The KEY003 is: \textbf{\textit{KEY003:SuZEnZMxliekAe9Wabxw9A==}}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task 02}
The next task is to find the name of Musical Venue which the address in question served as when Dr. Wilson's son was living in the house.
The single easiest way was to search the address in a search engine which will return result page like \href{https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ei=tI9qX5e3F4LJ5gLqo7qgBA&q=901+BUENA+VISTA+DR%2C+Tallahassee%2C+Florida&oq=901+BUENA+VISTA+DR%2C+Tallahassee%2C+Florida&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1D7MViqOWCCO2gAcAB4AIABfogBrgKSAQMyLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiX4Yj6-_3rAhWCpFkKHeqRDkQQ4dUDCAw&uact=5}{this}.
The 4\textsuperscript{th} or 5\textsuperscript{th} (excluding Ads) is a link to mapquest.com with title as \href{https://www.mapquest.com/us/florida/tv-land-tallahassee-380135641}{\textit{TV Land}}.
Now the KEY004 can trivially be built from the \textit{TV Land} name. The KEY004 is \textbf{\textit{KEY004:HTweEc/1klvNI2M7rhyH0A==}}.
