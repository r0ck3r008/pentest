The notes/questions in italics are the ones we haven’t exactly asked yet. There are other questions on the bottom too.

Scoping slides:
Network
Why is the customer having the penetration test performed against their environment? Is the penetration test required for a specific compliance requirement? 
Not compliance, just a full assessment of their security posture. What is exposed and what is at risk?
Primary concern: Providing a website very soon (won’t have access due to it being done by a third party), potential cloud use, but not set. Wants to make sure network is secure.
When does the customer want the active portions (scanning, enumeration, exploitation, etc...) of the penetration test conducted? During or after business hours? During the week or on weekends? 
Anytime except 30 minutes before and after UFSIT meeting times
How many internal/external IP addresses are being tested? 
23?
Are there any devices in place that may impact the results of a penetration test such as a firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system, web application firewall, or load balancer? 
“Impenetrable” firewall
No email server that we will encounter at this time. All servers in Florida (no international)

In the case that a system is penetrated, should we: 
Perform a local vulnerability assessment on the compromised machine? 
Find any vulnerabilities
Attempt to gain the highest privileges (root on unix machines, SYSTEM or Administrator on Windows machines) on the compromised machine? 
Find as many vulnerabilities as possible. Do whatever you gotta do.
Perform no, minimal, dictionary, or exhaustive password attacks against local password hashes obtained (for example, /etc/shadow on unix machines)? 
Password attacks are on the table. Exhaustive is possible, but not effective. Machines that we will use do not have a GPU so it won’t be possible. Do dictionary attacks.
Web Application
How many web applications are being assessed? 
F4rmC0rp.com, small number of pages.
How many login systems are being assessed? ‘
FTP
How many static pages are being assessed? (approximately) 
HT access files. Maybe like 6 pages
How many dynamic pages are being assessed? (approximately) 
None
Will the source code be readily available for viewing? 
No
Will there be any kind of documentation, if so, what kind? 
None external
Will we be performing static analysis on this application?
No - we can possibly find some other stuff
Does the client want us to perform fuzzing against this application? 
(Can if we want)
Does the client want us to perform role-based testing?
No 
Does the client want us to perform credentialed scans of web applications? 
No

Wireless
How many wireless networks are in place? 
(Wireless router provides access to disconnected network)
Is a guest wireless network used? If so, does the guest network require authentication? 
No, only secured EAP network. Radio server that provides authentication. 
What type of encryption is used on the wireless networks? 
WPA2AP
What is the square footage of coverage? 
Will we be enumerating rogue devices? 
Will we be assessing wireless attacks against clients? 
Yes, if you can exfiltrate data about clients, it is worth considering but possibly not feasible.
Approximately how many clients will be using the wireless network? 
No webcams, printers, etc...

Social Engineering
Will the client provide e-mail addresses of personnel that we can attempt to social engineer? 
Will the client provide phone numbers of personnel that we can attempt to social engineer? 
Will we be attempting to social engineer physical access, if so, how many people will be targeted?
Only Phineas


Rules of Engagement slides:
Rules of engagement are what we are able to do and not do. Essentially, limitations and capabilities. We also establish protocols for emergency contacts and data encryption
Phishing
Explain current popular phishing exploits. 
Some pretexts may use sensitive content (such offers targeting salacious desires or illegal activities, or even announcements concerning sensitive workplace issues) that companies do not want to deliver to their employees. 
Make sure that any pretexts to be used in phishing are approved by your customer. In particular, get specific approval of every phishing message to be sent.
Social engineering is off the table except Phineas

Emergency Contact Information
Identify how and how often information will be conveyed concerning the state of the penetration test. 
On Slack
Provide contact information about everyone involved in the penetration test including emergency contact information. 
Name - Matt Mason
Title - Chief Engineer
Emergency contact information (24/7)
Secure bulk data transfer method (sftp or encrypted email) 
 No bulk transfer
Agree to an incident reporting process
Whenever necessary (interim reports) Should have all the steps to replicate exploiting the vulnerability.
Share encryption keys. (This is not optional!) 
We won’t be taking data off the server

Ability to detect and respond
information gathering
foot printing
scanning and vulnerability analysis infiltration (attacks)
data aggregation
data ex-filtration 
Otto found something that was vulnerable and changed it. Cannot guarantee there will not be an incident response.
Firewalls on individual machines. No other web app firewall or anything else.


Rules of Engagement
Timeline for the test.
Start Sept. 8th - Dec. 3rd
Locations (if on-site) 
Remote  - NetLab
Method of disclosure of sensitive information.Data may be protected by HIPAA. Avoid copying personal health information (PHI) and other personally identifiable information (PII). 
Evidence handling (use encryption!)
Regular status meetings
Just the report
Time of day to test
UF SIT rules
Dealing with shunning 
No shunning. Notify Dr. Wilson if something like that happens.
Permission to test (including scope and possible negative outcomes of testing such as system instability, crashes, etc.) 
We will have our own VM and it will get reset each time.
Legal considerations (wiretapping laws, etc.) 
No compliance things or PCI. Assume no credit card #s


Questions asked during 1st zoom call:


Primary concern: Providing a website very soon (won’t have access due to it being done by a third party), potential cloud use, but not set. Wants to make sure network is secure.
Social Engineering is off the table, for now.
How many systems do you have on this network? What kind of physical infrastructure do you have?
A few linux development servers, a windows domain controller, 2-3 windows desktops used by employees (remote) (RDPing into using Remote Desktop), outward facing web server
Do you house any sensitive information where you'd need to comply with government policies?
No need for compliance tests
Are there any specific hours of the day you would like us to not work?
No testing when UF-SIT have their meetings (Thursdays 5pm-7pm)
What are the start and end dates for testing?
Is the outward facing server logically separated from the internal network (Is there a DMZ)?
Router between outward facing server maintained by ISP. Private network behind that router. DMZ is that address space maintained by ISP
Do you know the ip address? If so, could you tell us? What IP address are in/out of scope for this assessment?
172.30.0.128 (IP address) [NOT A REAL NETWORK] (www.f4rmc0rp.com)
172.30.0.0/24 (ISP) (24 bit network)
172.30.0.1 - out of scope
External penetration test (Not internal)
Assumed Breach Test- not doing this
Anything behind router is in scope. Test ANYTHING that is vulnerable. Don’t delete files if possible. Maintain CIA.
Point of Contact- Matt Mason
Do you use any VPNs?
Employees are using VPNs to access ISP facilities - not hosted by them
Are your employees aware of the activities we will be engaging in?
Employees are aware that a pen test is occurring

Will you be creating a backup of your company’s data or would you like us to do so?
No need to worry about data
Test anything and everything. Don’t delete any files
How should we handle discovered passwords hashes?
Report password and password hashes
Make sure to not include full passwords/hashes in case the report is leaked.
does www.f4rmc0rp.com work with any 3rd party that might be involved in the pentest?
Only 3rd party is ISP and they don’t care if we do a pen test
You said your role was as Chief Engineer. Are you able to authorize the penetration test? Are the people you report to also aware of the test?
Matt is authorized to give the penetration test
CEO is Sharon Shepherd and has given Matt authorization
How should we contact you, Matt?
Contact via Slack
Are there any devices in place that may impact the results of a pen test?
Firewall is “impenetrable”
How often and in what manner would you like to be updated about the state of the pen test?
No need to talk to Matt again. He’ll get the report
Are there different types of users on this network? Would you like us to see what each level of user can manage to get into?
Different kinds of users
Are there users we can access for social engineering?
Social Engineer Phineas

What is our overall goal for our pen test? Are we doing a full system check to find as many vulnerabilities as possible or are we trying to find a specific key/flag?
Test anything and everything.
Find out the security posture of F4rmc0rp.com

You’ll have access to plunder for scripts, artifacts, and info between accesses, screen captures, keys. Do we have to encrypt it?

Misc
Disclose found passwords in a reasonable way.
Only you are working on your pod. Can all be on plunder through the same router. 
If you find source code or internal documentation, you got it.
“Unauthorized authorized access is the best access.” You can get root access.

What is Mr. Oppenheimer's role?
System admin
What type of encryption is used on the wireless networks?
WPA2AP
Possible wireless pen test
Don’t DDOS the service. You can find out whether the system is vulnerable to DDOS attacks.

Opaque box. We don’t know everything.

Questions to ask:
Do we put the encryption key in the Rules of Engagement / Scoping document or do we put it elsewhere?
Won’t be able to get any information off of it.

Can we talk to Otto? (No)

You mentioned a FTP thing that Otto was using. Would you like us to perform any password attacks on the FTP thing or on any other password systems we find?
Password attacks are on the table
